# AutomationWebScrapingProject

𝐇𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐨, 𝐟𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰<𝚌𝚘𝚍𝚎𝚛𝚜/>!

In this project I have used Java, Selenium and PostgreSQL database for storing our scrapped data. Attached DataBase Schema.txt file for table creation 
under the "StockData" database in your PostgreSQL sever.

You'll also need a chormedriver; "https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads"

Added a tag.txt file containing tags of companies.

This project is using "https://www.screener.in/" for web data extraction.
