# AutomationWebScrapingProject

𝐇𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐨, 𝐟𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰<𝚌𝚘𝚍𝚎𝚛𝚜/>!

In this project I have used Java, Selenium and PostgreSQL database for storing our scrapped data.

Attached DatabaseSchema.txt file for table creation under the "StockData" database in your PostgreSQL sever.

You'll also need a chormedriver; "https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads"

Added a tags.txt file containing list of tags of companies.

This project is using "https://www.screener.in/" for web data extraction.

The following is the file structure that I have used.<br/>
Desktop/Alpha contains<br/>
    Alpha			//main project folder<br/>
    chromedriver.app<br/>
    tags.txt<br/>
    DatabaseSchema.txt<br/>
